Introduction to Unix Architecture
Unix is a multi-user, multitasking operating system known for its stability, security, and flexibility. Developed in the 1970s at AT&T Bell Labs, Unix has influenced many modern operating systems, including Linux and macOS.

Key Components of Unix Architecture:

Kernel – The core of Unix, managing hardware resources, memory, process scheduling, and system calls. It operates in privileged mode.
Shell – The interface between users and the kernel, allowing command execution. Popular shells include Bash, KornShell (ksh), and C Shell (csh).
File System – Unix follows a hierarchical file system starting from the root (/). Everything, including devices, is treated as a file.
Processes – Unix is multiprocessing, allowing background and foreground process execution. Each process has a Process ID (PID).
System Calls – Low-level functions allowing interaction between user programs and the kernel. Examples include fork(), exec(), and open().
Networking – Unix has built-in networking capabilities, supporting TCP/IP, SSH, FTP, and NFS.
Unix follows the philosophy of small, modular programs that perform specific tasks, allowing for flexibility and efficiency. Its architecture makes it ideal for servers, embedded systems, and enterprise applications.
