for our first class of the course "Introduction to Programming" I have learnt the applications of the main applications of the programming which are the ".C", which refers to the programming language "C", ".py" which refers to the programming language "Python" and ".txt" which refers to the textual files. Also there exist executional files known as ".exe". There are known some other textual files known as ".C", ".cdd", ".cc". Each application has its own branches: for instance ".c" has a branch named "compiler" and it has a branch ".exe". Likewise ".p". has an interpreter which translates and executes the codes at the same time that's why python is considered easier programming language and more preferable. ".txt" mainly refers to the programming language " JAVA" which is considered a "Mixed int. compiler". Also we have learnt that we can't work with "CPU"- s mainly because there is an intermediate layer which hides the necessary information from us.
